## Skiplist
- Skiplist is an ordered map (i.e it has ordered keys): [Ref](ttps://pkg.go.dev/github.com/huandu/skiplist#section-readme)
- It is a multi-leveled sorted linked list, where each level acts as an express lane to skip over a certain number of elements from the preceding levels. It is a lighter alternative to balanced BSTs.
- Key features:
  - On each level, nodes are sorted by keys.
  - All nodes in a skip list occupy its lowest level (level 0)
  - Each node has a "tower" with forward pointer(s) to the next node(s) on each corresponding level.
  - Probabilistic balancing of keys (using random no. generator)
  - Search/Insert/Delete operations 
    - Avg time: O(log n)
    - Worst case: O(n) when all elements have level = 1
- Why do we need it?
    - Although worst case time for balanced trees (AVL, self-balancing, etc) for Search/Insert/Delete is O(log n), they give poor perf. when input data is sorted due to constant rebalancing.
    - Skip lists have balance properties similar to that of search trees built by random insertions, yet do not require insertions to be random.
    - `MaxHeight` = `L(n)` = `log<sub>1/p</sub>n`
      - n = predicted max no. of elements that we expect to store.
      - p = fraction of nodes with level `i` pointers that also have level `i+1` pointers
- Search/Insert/Delete: [Ref](https://www.cloudcentric.dev/implementing-a-skip-list-in-go/)
  - During search, use `journey` array to keep track of immediate predecessor on each level. This helps with inserts/deletes. 
  - level = [0, MaxHeight-1]; height = [1, MaxHeight]
  - Interesting how author has generated a probability distribution for the height of a node.
